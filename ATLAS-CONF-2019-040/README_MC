To run the CKWWL merging:
- select 0 in the run_card:
 0 = ickkw            ! 0 no matching, 1 MLM
- correspondingly set to 0 the xqcut cut 
 0.0   = xqcut   ! minimum kt jet measure between partons

- select a value > 0 for ktdurham

 450.0  =  ktdurham        

( here should go the value prescribed by ATLAS i.e. mgluino/4 )

This parameter will also be set in the pythia8 card
